# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis - SQL & Python

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn for a bank using **SQL and Python**. The goal is to identify key factors driving churn and visualize insights to help the bank improve customer retention.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains customer details such as **age, gender, geography, credit score, number of products, and churn status**.

### 🔹 Data Cleaning (SQL)
- Handled missing values and inconsistencies.
- Removed duplicates and unnecessary columns.
- Exported the cleaned data for further analysis in Python.

## 📊 Analysis & Visualization (Python)
### **Key Insights Identified:**
✅ **Overall Churn Rate** – What percentage of customers left?  
✅ **Churn by Gender** – Do men or women churn more?  
✅ **Churn by Age Group** – Are younger or older customers more likely to leave?  
✅ **Churn by Geography** – Which regions have the highest churn rates?  
✅ **Churn by Credit Score** – Do low credit scores lead to higher churn?  
✅ **Churn by Number of Products** – Does having multiple products reduce churn risk?  

## 📌 Technologies Used
- **SQL Workbench** – Data cleaning
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn)** – Data analysis & visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook (Visual Studio Code)** – Code execution

## 🛠 How to Run
1. **Load the cleaned dataset** into your Python environment.
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook** to generate insights and visualizations.

## 📷 Sample Visualizations
- **Churn distribution (Pie chart)**
- **Churn rate by demographics (Bar charts)**
- **Impact of credit score & product count (Graphs)**

## 🎯 Key Takeaways
🔹 Banks can reduce churn by **targeting high-risk customer segments**.  
🔹 **Personalized offers & improved services** can enhance customer retention.  
🔹 **Data-driven decisions** help in customer engagement strategies.  

## 💡 Future Scope
🚀 Extend the project with **predictive modeling (Machine Learning)** to forecast churn probability.
